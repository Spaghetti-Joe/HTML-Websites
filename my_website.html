  <p style="font-family:cursive;">Heyo it's ya boi! Uhhhh makin' another website for school that may or may not be updated in the future. Well now I'm a sophomore now and I'm a more mature person than who I was before... ok that's a lie. If you really want to learn more about me (I don't know why you would want to in the first place) just look at the rest of this website. Enjoy I guess?</p>
